```

#### **Memory and Performance Bottlenecks**

### 6. Tiling and Coordinate Systems

#### **Tiling Algorithm Expertise**
```java
// Grid generation with coordinate transformations
TilingUtilities.createTiles() -> processTileGridRequest() ->
  - Serpentine patterns for efficient stage movement
  - Overlap calculation: xStep = frameWidth * (1 - overlapFraction)
  - Axis inversion handling for different stage configurations
  - ROI-based tile filtering for annotation-specific acquisition
```

#### **Coordinate Transformation Chain**
